This is a fork of Elijah Frederickson fork libstatusbar.

It contains some improvements and fixes including:
- Updated to use Logos (and many other syntax enhancements)
- Updated to use ARC* (Not Yet)
- Only hooks into UIKit processes using the MobileSubstrate filter
- Fix enumeration crash
- Allows icons in the center
- Fixes the "flash" when opening apps / icons not showing in apps until updateStatusBar is called (again)
- Doesn't cut off items when there are too many (probably causes some visual issues)
- Attempts to fix centering of multiple items in the center alignment

Negative changes:
- Dropped armv6 support (because I don't have the SDKs for it)
- (May have) dropped <iOS 7 support

Dont Even know if this properly supports iOS 9.3 or 10.X but sure
